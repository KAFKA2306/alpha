# Domain Block Integration Summary

Integration completed at: 2025-07-04 16:24:13.176418

## Integration Results

- Generated blocks loaded: 150
- Extended registry file: domain_blocks_mass_generated.py
- Registry class: MassGeneratedDomainBlockRegistry

## Block Categories

- attention: 17 blocks
- feature_extraction: 29 blocks
- financial_domain: 45 blocks
- mixing: 20 blocks
- normalization: 13 blocks
- regularization: 10 blocks
- temporal_processing: 16 blocks

## Usage

```python
# Import the mass generated registry
from domain_blocks_mass_generated import get_mass_generated_registry

# Get the registry
registry = get_mass_generated_registry()

# Print summary
registry.print_generation_summary()

# Get blocks by category
attention_blocks = registry.get_blocks_by_category('attention')
financial_blocks = registry.get_blocks_by_category('financial_domain')

# Get blocks by complexity
complex_blocks = registry.get_blocks_by_complexity('complex')
```

## Next Steps

1. Test the generated blocks with actual PyTorch modules
2. Validate block functionality and performance
3. Integrate into AI agent architecture exploration
4. Run diversity and effectiveness analysis
